# anything-lab
A repo for holding all the random files I will make as part of the Physics Advanced Lab course at the University of Leeds.
Almost always Python 2.7, but I suppose sometimes something else may come up...

## NMR.py
A _badly_ written script (bascially only works with iPython and with the files in the correct place...) for doing all the analysis and plotting for the NMR Advanced Lab experiment. Also finds tau values using BPP theory for validation and comparisson - an extension on the base lab script.
